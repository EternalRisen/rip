Honestly...

I'm just bored as fuck so I made this (with the help of [dorumin](https://github.com/dorumin))

to build this....

just make sure you have cargo(what is used with [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/))

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/YaBoiJD/rip

$ cd rip

$ cargo build (or cargo run)
```

## Usage:
