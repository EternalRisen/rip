Honestly...

to build this....

just make sure you have cargo(what is used with [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)) and [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

```bash
$ make

# make install
```

and ofc move this where apropriate(Or whatever the fuck you gotta do to it so it works) so it *actually* works
