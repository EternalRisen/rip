# RIP

Honestly...

I was just bored so I made this

soooo uhhh

## to build this....

just make sure you have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

```bash
$ cargo build
```

move this where appropriate (such as /usr/local/bin) so that you can use it in the command line as such:
`rip Emily`

## Usage:
`rip <string_here>` (or if you are in the project directory) `cargo run <string_here>`
